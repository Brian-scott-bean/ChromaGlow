## 2026-05-05 — Composer Engine Built (Antigravity/Gemini)

### What was built
- `CompositionModels.swift` — 4 layer configs (Palette, Motion, Envelope, Reaction) with full render math
- `CompositionEngine.swift` — Pure render engine, outputs CIE xy + brightness per light per frame
- `CompositionStore.swift` — JSON persistence + 20 built-in presets (5 ambient, 3 energetic, 12 holidays)
- `StudioViewModel.swift` — Added `.composition(presetID:)` strategy, `composerStudioCards`, apply/stop
- `UnifiedOrchestrator.swift` — Added `startCompositionMode()` with dual-transport (DTLS 25fps / REST 5fps)

### What's working
- ✅ All engine code compiles (BUILD SUCCEEDED)
- ✅ Existing Studio effects (Deck 1+2) unchanged and functional
- ✅ Multi-room concurrent effects still working
- ✅ 20 presets seed on first launch via JSON

### What's left (for next session)
- [ ] Phase 3A: Add Deck 3 to StudioView card carousel
- [ ] Phase 3B: Mixer tray layer tabs for compositions
- [ ] Phase 3C: Layer-specific slider controls
- [ ] Phase 3D: Save flow (name input → persist → new card)
- [ ] Phase 4: Polish (animations, haptics, seasonal banner)

### Gotchas
- `StudioStrategy` now requires `Equatable` conformance (added)
- `composerStudioCards` is a computed property, not a stored let (updates when store changes)
- Slider values write directly to `activeCompositionBox` — no debounce or API call needed
- The `sendColorParam` method searches `composerStudioCards` array too (line ~483)

### Current tag
`v0.17.0-cursor-ready`
